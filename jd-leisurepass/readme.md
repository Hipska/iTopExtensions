# jd-leisurepass

## What
An attempt at converting our inventory of leisure passes and checks from a legacy program to iTop.

Stuck due to a bug in iTop.

There is a bug in versions, definitely up to 2.6.2, where ExternalField doesn't "cascade" properly enough.
Let's say there's a class A (Person) and a class B (UserRequest).
Class B can perfectly inherit the phone number (single MySQL column) and picture (= multiple MySQL columns); so you can show the phone number and picture in UserRequest.

However, image a class C (perhaps WorkOrder?) which points to class B.
You can still show the phone number of the person (class A) in class C, since the MySQL query works for data stored in a single MySQL column.
You can no longer show the picture of the person (class A) in class C, since the MySQL query works for data stored in a multiple MySQL columns.


Actually I created a fix for AttributeImage which could be extended to AttributeBlob etc.
Would work in iTop, additional fixes might be needed for export. Unfortunately, because the patch is only written for AttributeImage, it has not been accepted by Combodo to be implemented in iTop.
