All extensions here are working. 
These extensions are being used in our own production environment. 

Some of my extensions work in cooperation with extensions which were written by my colleague. 
You can find his extensions on https://github.com/jbostoen/iTop-custom-extensions 

Be aware of my newer extensions:
* As of the moment ComRequest is still a rough version that isn't in production.
* HrComplaint and HrRequest are still being live tested by some users.
