All extensions here are working. 
These extensions are being used in our own production environment. 

Some of my extensions work in cooperation with extensions which were written by my colleague. 
You can find his extensions on https://github.com/jbostoen/iTop-custom-extensions 

Some extensions are used together with frontend websites, which are being used by our citizens, e.g.:
* https://meldingen.izegem.be (module: technicalrequest)
* https://zegheteens.izegem.be (module: participation)
* https://beleidsplan.izegem.be (module: projectpublication)
